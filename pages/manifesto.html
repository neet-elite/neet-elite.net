        <p>I won't bore you with anything lengthy, but here is my "<b>manifesto</b>" as it's typically called, condensed into a few bulletpoints.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>1. I'm here for a fun time.</b> That's it. I'm not online for anything other than fun, and whenever something stops being fun to me I easily and readily leave it behind. My enjoyment is my top priority, and I encourage you to do the same. Be selfish, it's important.</p>
        <p><b>2. It's cool to be kind.</b> Caring selfishly for myself doesn't suddenly eradicate my willingness and practice in being kind, and I make a point each day to remain kind in my interactions online. It's true what they say:<i> You never know what someone is going through behind the screen.</i> It's important to treat fellow net users with care.</p>
        <p><b>3. The net is yours.</b> Do whatever you want with it. Care not for crafting something "<i>important</i>" or "<i>unique</i>". As earnestly as possibleâ€” make something <b>you</b> and <b>only</b> you is happy with. Because ultimately, nothing else matters, and nobody can tell you otherwise. Not even me!!! Because the net is yours!</p>
        <p><b>4. MOST IMPORTANTLY TO ME: <i>THE NET IS FOR SHARING</i></b>. By this I mean I love to put content out <b>for free</b> for use by anyone!!! Sharing without any attachment, no credit, no requirements, no nothing! Just sharing because that's what the net is for. Everything and anything, from daily thoughts all the way up to software or the likes. We have unlimited connection at our fingertips and I think it should be used for sharing. Because, what else? Take it, break it, edit it, love it.</p>

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>It's difficult to describe myself, because I simultaneously have too much and not enough to say.</p>
                <p>Hi, I'm Mimi. I'm 26, a NEET, and I'm from Scotland. A hobbyist and creative. Writing, drawing, and coding are my main hobbies.</p>
                <p>The quote title is from my favourite game developer: <b>Suda51</b>. Do that which others are not doing. I'm sure you get the idea from the slogan alone, but I'm mentioning it here because it's something integral to me as a person. Punks not dead.</p>
                <h1>About The Site</h1>
                <p>I dunno man... Isn't it just fun to maintain one? Like, <b>"Hey, this is proof that I exist!"</b>... Something like that.</p>
